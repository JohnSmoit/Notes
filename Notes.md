## Exception Handling:

- **Try** is an exception related block of code that will throw an exception when something breaks.

- **Catch** is a block of code that executes when a specific type of exception is thrown.

- **Throw** is used to throw an exception and can be used to list exceptions that a function throws. Does not handle itself.
